# On-line Object Detection

This repository contains the python version of the source code for the experiments carried out for the On-line Object Detection project.

## Abstract
Object detection is a fundamental ability for robots interacting within an environment. While stunningly effective, state-of-the-art deep learning methods require huge amounts of labeled images and hours of training which does not favour such scenarios. In this project, we aim at designing algorithmic solutions to alleviate these requirements for this task, while preserving the state-of-the-art precision and reliability.
The proposed methods are typically validated on both computer vision and robotics datasets. This repository allows to reproduce the main experiments of the proposed works and allows the user to test the pipeline with other datasets.

## Description
![image](https://github.com/hsp-iit/paper-corl2020-onlineRPN/blob/master/images/rpn_pipeline_green_smaller.png)

This picture presents the current architecture of the pipeline. The Feature Extraction Module relies on Mask R-CNN architecture and the proposed On-line RPN, to extract deep features and predict RoIs from each input image. The On-line Detection Module performs RoIs classification and refinement, providing as output the detections for the input image. The green blocks are trained off-line on the FEATURE-TASK, while the yellow blocks are trained on-line on the TARGET-TASK.
